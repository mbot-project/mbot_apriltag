# mbot_apriltag

## Description
This project provides tools for camera calibration and Apriltag pose estimation, tailored for use with the MBot equipped with a **Jetson Nano** and **Raspberry Pi 5**.

In the `jetson_nano` and `pi5` folders, the scripts offer:
- Streaming live camera feeds to a browser for real-time viewing and interaction.
- Publishing and subscribing to Apriltag LCM messages.
- MBot following Apriltags.

## Installation and Usage

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the `README.md` in each folder `jetson_nano` or `pi5`. These are standalone projects, so you can remove either one if you donâ€™t need it for your setup.
